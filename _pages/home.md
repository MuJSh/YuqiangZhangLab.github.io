**Welcome to the Climate Health and Air quality for Next GEneration (CHANGE) Group at SDU**. 
Our research interests are broadly at the interactions between air quality, climate change and human health, urban air pollution, and depositions as well as ecosystem effects, by using global and regional chemical transport models ([CAM-Chem](https://www2.acom.ucar.edu/gcm/cam-chem), [GEOS-Chem](https://geos-chem.seas.harvard.edu/), [CAMQ](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq), & [Coupled WRF-CMAQ](https://www.epa.gov/cmaq/cmaq-models-0)).

To this end, our [research]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/research)  global and regional chemical transport models, machine learning, and data assimilation techniques. We maintain good cooperative relations with many well-known universities at home and abroad, and strongly recommend students and postdocs to go to overseas universities for exchange and cooperation.

We are part of the [Environment Research Institute](https://www.hj.sdu.edu.cn/index.htm) at [SDU](https://www.sdu.edu.cn/), a key comprehensive university with a long and honorable history, a broad variety of disciplines, strong academic strength and distinctive characteristics, which has had a great influence both at home and abroad.

We are seeking passionate Ph.D., Master, and Undergraduate students to join the group.
Please check out our [Openings]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/openings).
